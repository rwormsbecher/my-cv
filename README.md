## running the server
Use your favourite code editor and navigate to the projects root. Type the following command 

```
  npm i
  npm run dev
```

The project makes use of lite-server to automatically reload the webpage when changes have been made. Make sure that **port 3000** isn't running anything else! 

It has been tested on Chrome, Firefox, Edge and Ie11. Note that for IE11 we use a ponyfill to make the CSS custom properties work!
